## I have observed that many people encounter errors and difficulties while working with Git and Github, and often spend hours watching YouTube videos and reading lengthy blogs.


## Main Goal Of this Repository is to teach you:

1- How to create a repository on git<br>
2 - How to integrate it with Github remote respository.



## How to create a repository on git .

- Open your folder in VS Code and run these commands to globally authorize yourself first.



**Set up Git:**
   - Run the following commands to configure your name and email:

    git config --global user.name "xyz123"
     git config --global user.email "xyz123@gamil.com"
     

## The crucial aspect here is to ensure that you provide a space after the keywords ‚Äòname‚Äô and ‚Äòemail‚Äô. Verify that you are globally integrated with the terminal.


     
     git config --list

     



## You will be prompted for both your name and email in the terminal. After providing that information, run these commands to create an initial version of Git.



     git init

     touch Readme.md
     
     git status
    
     git add -A
       
     git status
       
     git commit -m"Added Readme File"
     
     git status
   
### After this, Now you can create your remote repository.


# How to integrate it with Github remote respository.



### Don‚Äôt Do this during Creating the Remote Repository


## Do not add any files such as a README or license file at this stage. Only add the name, description, and visibility. Once you have done this, run the final commands..

 


     git remote add origin "yourRemoteRepositoryClonedLink"

     git branch -M main

     git push -u origin main
    


##  And that‚Äôs it, your git and github repositores are connected.


 # Bonus Command

### If you have added files such as a license to your remote repository and wish to retrieve it to your local repository, simply run this command in your local repository‚Äôs terminal.


    git pull
    
## Thank you for reading .
